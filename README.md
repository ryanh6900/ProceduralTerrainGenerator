# ProceduralTerrainGeneratorandSceneRendererinJava
## **1. Procedural Terrain Generator**:
This project is Procedural Terrain Generator. It takes information from PNG files and then, using an generation algorithm I implemented involving height maps, create the terrain
in a 3D space. I will detail the important components of algorithm below.

### The main functions of this project:
- Create a grid of customizable size and detail using the GUI controls
- Load terrain data from a PNG file 
- Load the the terrain data as 3D terrain data on the grid the user creates. 
- Maps colors to terrain elevation, terrain of highest elevation marked by white(snow), terrain of lowest is marked as blue(water)
- User is able to adjust the appearance of the grid by
